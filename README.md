## About
VekAmp is intended to be a cross platform music player and library management tool making use of the [BASS audio library](https://www.un4seen.com/bass.html). 

The main motivation for this project is to replace my currently used music player (which is Windows exclusive) with one that can be used across several platforms, so that I can get what I'm looking for out of a music player on any platform I may use. I also intend to add a plethora of powerful library management systems to make sure your library is organised and stored in the way you want it to.
>[!NOTE]
>This project is still in it's infancy, If there are any suggestions or feedback you would like to provide, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/vektor451/vekamp/issues/new).

## Current Plans
Currently, the goal for the project's development, and this branch, is to get the audio library to play music files. The progress for this goal is as follows:
- [x] Link bass.dll and interface with it.
- [x] Successfully intialise the audio system.
- [x] Play an audio file from the command line.

It works!! ðŸ¥³

## Platforms
Currently, this branch is only intended for Win64 systems. 

## Compiling
Currently the project compiles with CMake with MSVC, which are required to successfully compile the project. 

Before compilation, it is important to place the necessary library files in their directories. Check the folders in `vendor` for more information.
